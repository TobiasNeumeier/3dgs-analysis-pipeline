## NerfSyntheticDatasetExporter

This class can be used to export NerfSynthetic datasets from blender by using the code provided in _usage.py_ within the blender scripting tab.

## PlyWrapper

The PlyWrapper class is able to import .ply files generated by training 3DGS models using https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting.
